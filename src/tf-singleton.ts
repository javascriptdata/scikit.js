============================
Howdy ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹. Looks like you are running scikit but you haven't set a Tensorflow backend. 
To do so, simply import (or require) your tensorflow library, and call setBackend like so,

import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs'
import * as sk from 'scikitjs'
sk.setBackend(tf)

That will let scikit know you wish to use a tensorflow library to perform your calculations.
